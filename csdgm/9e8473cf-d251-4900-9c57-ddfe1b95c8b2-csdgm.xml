			<abstract>This EnviroAtlas dataset represents the percentage of land area that is classified as forest, forest including woody wetlands, and natural land cover that occurs within 45 meters of streams, rivers, and other hydrologically connected waterbodies within each 12-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) in the conterminous United States. Land cover is defined using the EnviroAtlas hybrid 2016 Cropland Data Layer (CDL) - 2016 National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD). Streams were derived from the NHD (National Hydrography Dataset) High Resolution dataset obtained June 2020. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).</abstract>
			<purpose>This dataset is useful for evaluating the potential value of ecosystem services provided by vegetation communities, and the impacts of developed land cover. The overall goal of EnviroAtlas is to employ and develop the best available science to map indicators of ecosystem services production, demand, and drivers for the nation.</purpose>

				<procdesc>Processed each NHDFlowline feature class in the NHD with the StrmLine HiRes Iterative Tool in the AtlasAnalyses Toolbox (a self-created toolbox for the purpose of standardizing analyses for the EnviroAtlas). The StrmLine HiRes Iterative tool performs the following operations:</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200616</procdate>
				<procdesc>Step 1 - Iterates through the NHD Workspace and processes each NHD High Resolution geodatabase found there.</procdesc>

			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200621</procdate>
				<procdesc>Step 3 - NHDAreas with "FTYPE" = WASH are selected.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200621</procdate>
				<procdesc>Step 4 - Select by Location is used to reduce the selected washes to only those that are within 1 Meters of features in the corresponding strmLineXXXX, where XXXX is the current 4-digit HU code.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200621</procdate>
				<procdesc>Step 5 - NHDArea features with FTYPE = StreamRiver or Rapids or Lock Chamber are added to the selected Washes.</procdesc>

			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200621</procdate>
				<procdesc>Step 11 - A second dissolve is performed on NHD_MergeXXXX, again using the "dummy" field and not opting for multipart output features. The second dissolve helps to reduce splits in polygons sometimes introduced when the GIS software resorts to tiling to process large datasets.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>

			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200806</procdate>
				<procdesc>Buffer zones within 45 meters of streams, rivers, and other hydrologically connected waterbodies were generated using the Riparian Land Cover Proportions tool in the Riparian Characteristics toolset of the ATtILA for ArcGIS toolbox (ATtILA 10_0.tbx, 5/26/2016 version) in ArcGIS by selecting INTERMEDIATES from the Additional Options parameter. Used NHDPlusV2_WBDSnapshot_EnviroAtlas_CONUS as the reporting unit feature, cdlnlcd2016_EA_ND as the land cover grid, and the respective strmLine####_NAP and strmAreal#### shapefiles for each NHD 2-digit HUC region as the stream features. A user-defined land cover scheme for the hybrid CDL-NLCD dataset was used to identify land cover classes. Output buffer feature classes were saved in a separate geodatabase for each NHD 2-digit HUC region. The ATtILA tool was used because it restricts buffer zones from crossing HUC boundaries.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200813</procdate>
				<procdesc>Merged the buffer themes separately for each NHD 2-digit HUC geodatabase. The output feature class naming convention was Buffers45_HU##, where ## is the 2-digit HUC code.</procdesc>

				<procdesc>Added a text field named, HUC_8, to the attribute table for Buffers45_NHD_HUCS, and calculated its values as !HUC_12![:8]</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200815</procdate>
				<procdesc>For each 2-digit HUC region, used Select By Attribute to select all of the buffer segments with the same 2-digit HUC prefix in Buffers45_NHD_HUCS: HUC_12 LIKE '##%', where ## is the 2-digit HUC code.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200815</procdate>
				<procdesc>For each 2-digit HUC region, exported the selected records into a temporary work geodatabase. The naming convention for the exported feature classes was, Buffers45_HU##_raw, where ## is the 2-digit HUC code.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200815</procdate>
				<procdesc>For each 2-digit HUC region, performed a Frequency analysis on the HUC_8 field in the Buffers45_HU##_raw feature class. The frequency table was named, HUC##_List, where ## is the 2-digit HUC abbreviation.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200815</procdate>
				<procdesc>For each 2-digit HUC region, ran the NHD HUC 2 WBD HUC tool from the AtlasAnalyses toolbox. This tool steps through the list of 8-digit HUC codes in the HUC##_List table and selects by attribute all of the buffer polygons in Buffers45_HU##_raw with matching values in the HUC_8 field. The selected buffer polygons are copied into a new feature class named, Buffer45_########, where ######## is the 8-digit HUC code. A separate feature class is created for each 8-digit HUC code record in the HUC##_List.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200815</procdate>
				<procdesc>Performed Repair Geometry on all generated Buffer45_######## feature classes, where ######## is the 8-digit HUC code.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200815</procdate>
				<procdesc>Performed a dissolve operation on each Buffer45_######## feature class using HUC_12 as the Dissolve Field. Create multipart features was selected. The output feature class was named, Buffer45_########_D.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200815</procdate>
				<procdesc>Performed Repair Geometry on all Buffer45_########_D feature classes, where ######## is the 8-digit HUC code.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200817</procdate>
				<procdesc>Merged the dissolved and repaired 12-digit HUC buffer feature classes into 2-digit HUC groups. The outputs were named, Buffers_HU##_WBD, where ## is the 2-digit HUC code.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200817</procdate>
				<procdesc>Land cover in the buffer zones in each 2-digit HUC regions were calculated using the Land Cover Proportions tool in the Landscape Characteristics toolset of the ATtILA for ArcGIS toolbox (ATtILA 10_0.tbx, 2/16/2016 version) in ArcGIS. Calculated NINDEX, pFor, and pFor90. Used NHDPlusV2_WBDSnapshot_EnviroAtlas_CONUS as the reporting unit feature and cdlnlcd2016_EA_ND as the land cover grid. Used a user-defined land cover scheme (CDL NLCD Hybrid 2016 ICELAND) for the hybrid CDL-NLCD dataset. The ICELAND designation in the land cover scheme indicates that areas of perennial ice is considered as available LAND in the percentage calculations. The output tables were named, RLCP45_NAP_HU##, where ## is the 2-digit HUC code.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200819</procdate>
				<procdesc>Merged the RLCP45_NAP_HU## output files into RLCP2016_CONUS</procdesc>

			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200826</procdate>
				<procdesc>Joined the RLCP2016_CONUS_NotAllHUCS table to the HUC12_IDS table (a table with a record for each of the 12-digit HUC code in the NHDPlusV2_WBDSnapshot_EnviroAtlas_CONUS feature class) using the common HUC_12 field.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200826</procdate>

			<eaover>These metrics were generated using the ATtILA tool (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/attila-toolbox), an ArcGIS tool for calculating commonly used landscape metrics. The land cover input is the EnviroAtlas 2016 CDL-NLCD, a raster dataset that is a hybrid of the 2016 NLCD (www.mrlc.gov/) and the 2016 CDL (https://www.nass.usda.gov/Research_and_Science/Cropland/SARS1a.php). The stream inputs were derived from the NHDFlowline, NHDWaterbody, and NHDArea feature classes in the NHD High Resolution datasets ( https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography/access-national-hydrography-products). For more information on the metric calculation, please see the ATtILA User's Manual included with the toolbox. A comprehensive list of metric creation steps is included in the Processing Steps.</eaover>
