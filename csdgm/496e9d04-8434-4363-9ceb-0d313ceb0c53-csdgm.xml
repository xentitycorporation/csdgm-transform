			<abstract>This EnviroAtlas dataset represents the percentage of land area that is classified as forest, forest including woody wetlands, and natural land cover that occurs within 45 meters of streams, rivers, and other hydrologically connected waterbodies within each 12-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) in Alaska. Land cover is defined using the 2016 National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD). Streams were derived from the NHD (National Hydrography Dataset) High Resolution dataset obtained June 2020. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).</abstract>
			<purpose>This dataset is useful for evaluating the potential value of ecosystem services provided by vegetation communities, and the impacts of developed land cover. The overall goal of EnviroAtlas is to employ and develop the best available science to map indicators of ecosystem services production, demand, and drivers for the nation.</purpose>

			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200831</procdate>
				<procdesc>Step 8 - The selected NHDWaterbodies and selected NHDAreas are merged into a new feature class named, NHD_MergeXXXX, where XXXX is the current 4-digit HU code.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200831</procdate>
				<procdesc>Step 9 - An integer type field named, "dummy", is added to NHD_MergeXXXX, and its value is calculated as 1.</procdesc>

				<procdate>20200831</procdate>
				<procdesc>Buffer zones within 45 meters of streams, rivers, and other hydrologically connected waterbodies were generated using the Riparian Land Cover Proportions tool in the Riparian Characteristics toolset of the ATtILA for ArcGIS toolbox (ATtILA 10_0.tbx, 5/26/2016 version) in ArcGIS by selecting INTERMEDIATES from the Additional Options parameter. Used NHDPlusV2_WBDSnapshot_EnviroAtlas_AK as the reporting unit feature, NLCD2016AK_ND as the land cover grid, and the respective strmLine####_NAP and strmAreal#### shapefiles for each NHD 4-digit HUC region as the stream features. A user-defined land cover scheme for the NLCD2016AK_ND (NLCD 2001-2016 ICELAND) dataset was used to identify land cover classes. Output buffer feature classes were saved in the NAPBuffers_HU19 geodatabase. The ATtILA tool was used because it restricts buffer zones from crossing HUC boundaries.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200901</procdate>
				<procdesc>Ran into an issue with strmLine1903 as this dataset encompasses the Aleutian Islands and crosses the international date line. StrmLine1903 was reprojected into the same projection as the NLCD_2016_Land_Cover_AK_20200213 raster before reprocessing the buffer zones using the Riparian Land Cover Proportions tool. Due to the size of the stream line feature dataset, the file was subsetted into smaller sections to allow for processing.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>2020903</procdate>
				<procdesc>Merged the buffer themes in NAPBuffers_HU19.gdb. The output was saved in a geodatabase named, NAPBuffersAK.gdb. The output was named, Buffers45_HU19.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200903</procdate>
				<procdesc>The Delete Identical (Data Management) tool was used on the Buffers45_HU19 feature class.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200903</procdate>
				<procdesc>Added a text field named, HUC_8, to the attribute table for Buffers45_HU19, and calculated its values as !HUC_12![:8]</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200903</procdate>
				<procdesc>Performed a Frequency analysis on the HUC_8 field in the Buffers45_HU19 feature class. The frequency table was named, HUC19_HUC_8_List.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200903</procdate>
				<procdesc>Ran the NHD HUC 2 WBD HUC tool from the AtlasAnalyses toolbox. This tool steps through the list of 8-digit HUC codes in the HUC19_HUC_8_List table and selects by attribute all of the buffer polygons in Buffers45_HU19 with matching values in the HUC_8 field. The selected buffer polygons are copied into a new feature class named, Buffer45_########, where ######## is the 8-digit HUC code. A separate feature class is created for each 8-digit HUC code record in the HUC19_HUC_8_List.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200903</procdate>
				<procdesc>Performed Repair Geometry on all generated Buffer45_######## feature classes, where ######## is the 8-digit HUC code.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200903</procdate>
				<procdesc>Performed a dissolve operation on each Buffer45_######## feature class using HUC_12 as the Dissolve Field. Create multipart features was selected. The output feature class was named, Buffer45_########_D.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200903</procdate>
				<procdesc>Performed Repair Geometry on all Buffer45_########_D feature classes, where ######## is the 8-digit HUC code.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200903</procdate>
				<procdesc>Merged the dissolved and repaired 8-digit HUC buffer feature classes into Buffers_HU19_WBD.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20201028</procdate>
				<procdesc>Land cover in the buffer zones was calculated using the Land Cover Proportions tool in the Landscape Characteristics toolset of the ATtILA for ArcGIS toolbox (ATtILA 10_0.tbx, 5/26/2016 version) in ArcGIS. Calculated NINDEX, pFor, and pFor90. Used NHDPlusV2_WBDSnapshot_EnviroAtlas_AK as the reporting unit feature and NLCD2016AK_ND as the land cover grid. Used a user-defined land cover scheme (NLCD 2011 ICELAND) for the NLCD dataset. The ICELAND designation in the land cover scheme indicates that areas of perennial ice is considered as available LAND in the percentage calculations and as a natural land cover class. The output table was named, RLCP2016_AK_ICE.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20201029</procdate>
				<procdesc>Joined the output table, RLCP2016_AK_ICE, to WBDSnapshot_EnviroAtlas_AK using the common HUC_12 field. Turned off all fields save HUC_12, NINDEX, pfor, and pfor90, and exported the joined table to make the join permanent. The output was saved in the Results.gdb and named, RLCP2016ICE_AK.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20201029</procdate>
				<procdesc>Used Alter Field to change the following field names in RLCP2016ICE_AK: NINDEX to rNI45, pFor to rFOR45, and pFor90 to rFOR90.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20201029</procdate>

			<eaover>These metrics were generated using the ATtILA tool (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/attila-toolbox), an ArcGIS tool for calculating commonly used landscape metrics. The land cover input is the 2016 NLCD (www.mrlc.gov/). The stream inputs were derived from the NHDFlowline, NHDWaterbody, and NHDArea feature classes in the NHD High Resolution datasets ( https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography/access-national-hydrography-products). For more information on the metric calculation, please see the ATtILA User's Manual included with the toolbox. A comprehensive list of metric creation steps is included in the Processing Steps.</eaover>
