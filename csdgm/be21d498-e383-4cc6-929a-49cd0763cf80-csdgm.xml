			<abstract>This EnviroAtlas dataset represents the percentage of land area that is classified as tree canopy cover using the National Land Cover Database 2016 USFS Tree Canopy Cover dataset for each 12-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) in Hawaii. Streams were derived from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) High Resolution dataset obtained June 2020.
				This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).</abstract>
			<purpose>This dataset is useful for evaluating the potential value of ecosystem services provided by vegetation communities, and the impacts of developed land cover. The overall goal of EnviroAtlas is to employ and develop the best available science to map indicators of ecosystem services production, demand, and drivers for the nation.</purpose>

				<procdesc>Processed each NHDFlowline feature class in the NHD with the StrmLine HiRes Iterative Tool in the AtlasAnalyses Toolbox (a self-created toolbox for the purpose of standardizing analyses for the EnviroAtlas). The StrmLine HiRes Iterative tool performs the following operations:</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200916</procdate>
				<procdesc>Step 1 - Iterates through the NHD Workspace and processes each NHD High Resolution geodatabase found there.</procdesc>
			</procstep>

				<procdate>20200916</procdate>
				<procdesc>Step 2 - From the current geodatabase, the NHDFlowline feature class is found in the Hydrography feature dataset.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200916</procdate>
				<procdesc>Step 3 - Flowlines with "FTYPE" = 460 OR "FTYPE" = 334 OR "FTYPE" = 558 are then selected</procdesc>

			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200916</procdate>
				<procdesc>Step 5 - Identifying the end points of the flowline then begins by converting all vertices from the selected flowlines to points.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200916</procdate>
				<procdesc>Step 6 - The ArcGIS Near (Analysis) tool is then employed using the vertices point layer as both the input features and the near features.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200916</procdate>
				<procdesc>Step 7 - The StrmLine HiRes Iterative Tool concludes by copying points with a near distance greater than 0 into a new feature class named, strmEndXXXX, where XXXX is the 4-digit HU code. Only the Near_Dist field is retained from the Near operation.</procdesc>

				<procdesc>Processed each NHDArea and NHDWaterbody feature class in the NHD with the StrmAreal HiRes Iterative Tool in the AtlasAnalyses Toolbox (a self-created toolbox for the purpose of standardizing analyses for the EnviroAtlas). The StrmAreal HiRes Iterative tool performs the following operations:</procdesc>

			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200916</procdate>
				<procdesc>Step 3 - NHDAreas with "FTYPE" = WASH are selected.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200916</procdate>
				<procdesc>Step 4 - Select by Location is used to reduce the selected washes to only those that are within 1 Meters of features in the corresponding strmLineXXXX, where XXXX is the current 4-digit HU code.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200916</procdate>

			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200916</procdate>

			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200916</procdate>

			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200916</procdate>
				<procdesc>Step 10 - NHD_MergeXXXX is then dissolved based on the "dummy" field. Multipart features are not created. Only boundaries between polygons immediately adjacent to each other are dissolved.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200916</procdate>
				<procdesc>Step 11 - A second dissolve is performed on NHD_MergeXXXX, again using the "dummy" field and not opting for multipart output features. The second dissolve helps to reduce splits in polygons sometimes introduced when the GIS software resorts to tiling to process large datasets.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200916</procdate>
				<procdesc>Step 12 - Select by Location is used to select areal water features in NHD_MergeXXXX that are within 1 Meters of features in the corresponding strmENDXXXX feature class.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200916</procdate>
				<procdesc>Step 13 - Select by Location is used to add to the selected features in NHD_MergeXXXX any areal water feature that intersects the line features in the corresponding strmLineXXXX feature class.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200916</procdate>
				<procdesc>Step 14 - The StrmAreal HiRes Iterative Tool ends by copying the selected features in NHD_MergeXXXX into a new feature class named, strmArealXXXX, where XXXX is the current 4-digit HU code.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200916</procdate>
				<procdesc>For each strmLine#### feature class, all features where Ftype did not equal 558 (Artificial Paths) were selected and saved as strmLine####_NAP. NAP stands for No Artificial Paths and #### is the 4-digit HUC code from the NHD.</procdesc>
			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200916</procdate>
				<procdesc>Buffer zones within 45 meters of streams, rivers, and other hydrologically connected waterbodies were generated using the Riparian Land Cover Proportions tool in the Riparian Characteristics toolset of the ATtILA for ArcGIS toolbox (ATtILA 10_0.tbx, 5/26/2016 version) in ArcGIS by selecting INTERMEDIATES from the Additional Options parameter. Used NHDPlusV2_WBDSnapshot_EnviroAtlas_HI as the reporting unit feature, CNPY2016HI_NoWater as the land cover grid, and the respective strmLine####_NAP and strmAreal#### shapefiles for each NHD 2-digit HUC region as the stream features. A user-defined land cover scheme for the C-C-CAP dataset was used to identify land cover classes. Output buffer feature classes where saved in a geodatabase for the NHD HUC region (NAPBuffers_HU20.gdb). The ATtILA tool was used because it restricts buffer zones from crossing HUC boundaries.</procdesc>

			</procstep>
			<procstep>
				<procdate>20200916</procdate>
				<procdesc>Ran the NHD HUC 2 WBD HUC tool from the AtlasAnalyses toolbox with Buffers45_HU20 as the input . This tool steps through the list of 8-digit HUC codes in the HUC20_List table and selects by attribute all of the buffer polygons in Buffers45_HU20 with matching values in the HUC_8 field. The selected buffer polygons are copied into a new feature class named, Buffer45_########, where ######## is the 8-digit HUC code. A separate feature class is created for each 8-digit HUC code record in the HUC20_List.</procdesc>

				<procdesc>Calculation for Percent Tree Canopy within the 45 meter riparian buffer zone for each 12-digit HUC was done using the Zonal Statistics as Table tool with Buffers45_HU20_WBD as the Input feature zone data, the HUC_12 field as the Zone field, and CNPY2016HI_NoWater as the Input value raster. The Ignore NoData checkbox was checked. The output table was named, R45CNPY2016_WBD20.</procdesc>

			<eaover>The metric was generated using the Zonal Statistics as Table tool in ArcGIS 10.7 for Desktop. Buffer zones within 45 meters of streams, rivers, and other hydrologically connected waterbodies were generated using the Riparian Land Cover Proportions tool in the Riparian Characteristics toolset of the ATtILA for ArcGIS toolbox (ATtILA 10_0.tbx, 5/26/2016 version) in ArcGIS from select water features in the NHD High Resolution dataset obtained June 2020. The ATtILA tool was used because it restricts buffer zones from crossing HUC boundaries. CNPY2016HI_NoWater, derived from the NLCD 2016 USFS Tree Canopy Cover (https://www.mrlc.gov/data), was used as the Input value raster.
